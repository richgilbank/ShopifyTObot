#ShopifyTObot

This bot does a few things - look through the source to track them all.
This is my first bot, be gentle.


##Installation

Open up the directory you cloned into.
* You'll have to add your Twitter credentials to config.js, which can be obtained from https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new
* `npm install` will pull all the dependencies into your local node_modules folder
* `coffee bot.coffee` will run the bot

##Credits

Any work I've done here is largely based on the work of Darius Kazemi (Twitter: @tinysubversions, Github: @dariusk), so credit where credit is due :)
